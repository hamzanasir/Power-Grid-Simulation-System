# Power Grid Simulation System

An extensive power usage simulation system that takes input from a text file for every appliance in multiple locations and simulate at random how many appliances will be On, Off or in their SmartOn mode (if they have one) at any given instance in time. The program uses concepts of inheritance, discrete event algorithms, input output streams etc. to monitor and control the power grid after a user-defined amount of time. It can shut off specific appliances or temporarily "brown out" locations, if the power grid is over-loaded. The user can also add appliances to the main database. In the end it prints out a comprehensive report in the form of a text file for the user to review the course of events that took place.
